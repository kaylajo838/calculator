# Calculator
This project was a challenge from The Odin Project. It was a huge chakllenge for me. I put the project aside for awhile, so I could learn more and come back to make it functional. It still isn't quite finished, but most all functions of the calculator are working.

Note: No mobile support at this time. In addition, I plan to come back later and apply more styling to the UI.
